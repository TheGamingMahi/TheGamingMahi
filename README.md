## About Me
I'm a developer focused on creating useful Minecraft server plugins and tools. I specialize in **Lua-based Bukkit/Spigot plugins** using the Lukkit framework, building solutions that server administrators actually need.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies & Skills
- **Lua** - Primary language for Minecraft plugin development and Roblox game creation
- **HTML/CSS** - Web development
- **JSON** - Data storage and configuration
- **Minecraft Server Administration** - Plugin architecture and server management

## ðŸŽ® Featured Projects
My plugins focus on practical server administration and gameplay enhancement:
- **Random teleportation systems** with smart safety detection
- **Server monitoring and logging tools** for administration
- **Gameplay modification plugins** for enhanced experiences
- **Utility plugins** that solve common server problems

## ðŸ“Š Current Focus
- Developing cross-compatible Minecraft plugins (1.8 - 1.21+)
- Creating user-friendly installation systems
- Building efficient, lightweight server tools
- Maintaining compatibility across different server implementations

## ðŸŒŸ Philosophy
I believe in creating plugins that:
- **Just work** out of the box with minimal setup
- **Solve real problems** that server owners face
- **Maintain compatibility** across Minecraft versions
- **Perform efficiently** without impacting server resources
